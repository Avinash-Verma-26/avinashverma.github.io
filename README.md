 An elegant way of organizing a portfolio. 


This comes as a result of procrastinating with the idea of a very visually pleasing and "aesthetic" portfolio website. What I really needed was not just beautiful visuals but a more structured and clean way of representing my work and ideas. The AI-driven _'Make your own website'_ revolution that has taken place over the past few months has made me realize the importance of a simple, elegant showcase of work, rather than being a follower of the latest visual trend.
